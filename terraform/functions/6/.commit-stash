test(terraform): add comprehensive function examples & tests

Introduces a complete suite of Terraform/OpenTofu function examples
demonstrating numeric operations, date formatting, collection
manipulation, filesystem operations, and cryptographic hashing.
Each example includes both implementation code and corresponding
test files using the .tftest.hcl format.

The examples cover six key functional areas:
1. Numeric functions - sum() for basic arithmetic operations
2. Environment multipliers - lookup() with environment-specific
   scaling using dev/stage/prod multipliers
3. Date formatting - formatdate() for RFC3339 timestamp
   transformations
4. Collection indexing - element() for list access including
   negative indexing, and lookup() for map operations with
   default value fallbacks
5. Filesystem operations - file() and fileset() with pattern
   matching, demonstrating wildcard support and suffix trimming.
   Includes intentional typo (emeral vs emerald) to show
   contains() behavior with missing elements
6. Hash functions - sha256() and filesha256() for file integrity
   verification

Example 5 and 6 demonstrate a critical evaluation timing
constraint: file() and filesha256() require plan/apply execution
to evaluate, unlike pure functions which can be tested during
variable assignment. This is documented with commented-out test
cases showing the "Unknown condition run" error that occurs when
attempting premature evaluation in variable assignments.

These examples serve as reference implementations for testing
Terraform built-in functions and understanding the evaluation
lifecycle within the test framework. The comprehensive README
files explain patterns, limitations, and best practices for each
functional category.
