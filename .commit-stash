suboptimal solution of the GetRandom O(1) problem

Before optimization we need to write benchmarks and test tables.

Only after that we can tackle memory and time optimization:
- The `GetRandom` function is O(N) in time and memory where N is the
  size of the population (vals * counts).  We should look up how to
  improve this with adapted data structures and some sort of
  memoization.
- `Insert` and `Remove` functions are O(1) and we are fine.
